## Report your process
Reflect on what was hard/easy, problems you solved, helpful tutorials you read, etc. What things were hard, even though you saw them in class? What was easy(-ish) even though we havenâ€™t done it in class?

### Trouble faced to create new Homework Directory and re-shuffling the files within hw01 folder.
I faced a lot of trouble in creating a hw folder and also in creating 2 subfolders with names : hw01,hw02.I got some help in creating directories/folders using this [link.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12258399/how-to-create-folder-in-github-repository)
I had to create new repos,delete several repos but finally I think I got it right! 

I made local changes using R studio ,to move my [hw01 files.](https://github.com/jmurthy12/STAT545-hw-murthy-janani/tree/master/hw01)into the [new repo.](https://github.com/jmurthy12/STAT545-hw-murthy-janani)


### Readme file
Since was done as a part of hw01.No problems encountered here, links were easily added!

### R Markdown
Creating a markdown file was quite easy!
I did refer to [class notes](http://stat545.com/cm006_tibbles-dplyr-ggplot2.htmls)for ggplot and dplyr functions.
