## About Myself
Hello ,I'm **Janani Murthy**,doing my Masters in Electrical an Computer Engineering.I'm interested in the fields of *Wireless communications* and *Big Data*.This [course](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC) aids in building my knowledge on R programming.

That's me!

Steps that I followed to edit the *README.md* were :
1. Create a new repo on GitHub
2. Cloned the repo to local  R repository
3. Edit the *README.md* file in RStudio
4. Experimented with R Markdown aspects such as : Bold, Italics, adding a Link and Headers.
5. Saved the changes made to the *README.md* file
6. Commited the changes and triggered a PULL followed by a PUSH.

This is my first experience with Github and R Markdown.The hands-on experience provided by this [course](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC) makes it easier to understand. I'm really excited to explore further on these topics. 

This is my [R markdown document](https://github.com/jmurthy12/STAT545-hw02-murthy-janani/blob/master/hw01/hw01_gapminder.Rmd) and my [Rendered Markdown File](https://github.com/jmurthy12/STAT545-hw02-murthy-janani/blob/master/hw01/hw01_gapminder.md)
