## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r}
typeof(typeof(15.2))
```
```{r}

filter(gapminder, (country=="Canada") |(country == "Algeria" & year>=1969 & year <= 1960))
filter(gapminder, (country=="Canada") |(country == "Algeria" & year>=1969 & year <= 1960))
```

```{r}
arrange(gapminder, year, desc(lifeExp))
```

```{r}
mutate(gapminder, gdp = gdpPercap * pop)
```
```{r}
summarize(gapminder, mean_pop=mean(pop), sd_pop=sd(pop))
```


```{r}
gapminder %>% 
    group_by(country) %>% 
    summarize(mean_pop=mean(pop), sd_pop=sd(pop))
```
```{r}
summary(gapminder)
```
Exercise: Find the minimum GDP per capita experienced by each country
```{r}
gapminder %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  summarise (mingdp = min(gdpPercap))
```
Exercise: How many years of record does each country have?
```{r}
gapminder %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  summarise (nyears)
```
```{r}
gapminder %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  summarise (n_distinct(year))
```
Exercise: Within Asia, what are the min and max life expectancies experienced in each year?
```{r}
gapminder %>%
  filter(continent== "Asia") %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise (minexp = min(lifeExp),
             maxexp = max(lifeExp))
```

Quick ways: - plot(gapminder$year, gapminder$lifeExp) - base R - qplot(year, lifeExp, data=gapminder) -  ggplot2's "quick plot".

```{r}
ggplot(gapminder, aes(x=year, y=lifeExp)) 
```
```{r}
p <- ggplot(gapminder, aes(x=year, y=lifeExp))
p
```

p+geom_point(alpha = 0.25), Alpha on everything on the plot should be 0.25 transparency

```{r}
p+geom_point(alpha = 0.25)
```

```{r}
p + geom_point(aes(alpha = 0.25))
p
```

p <- ggplot(gapminder, aes(x=year, y=lifeExp))
Exercises:

Make a scatterplot of gdpPercap vs lifeExp. Store it in a variable called p2.
```{r}
p2 <- ggplot(gapminder, aes(x=gdpPercap, y=lifeExp))+
    geom_point()
p2
```


To p2, make the size of the points indicate the year, choose a level of alpha transparency that you're happy with, and make the points your favourite colour.
```{r}
p2 + geom_point(aes(size = year),alpha =0.1,colour = "blue")
```


To p2, colour the points by continent. but this time with year being represented by the size of the points.
```{r}
p2 + geom_point(aes(size = year),alpha =0.1,colour = "blue")
```


To p2, add another layer called scale_x_log10(). Make a second plot by redoing the plot in (1), but replacing gdpPercap with log10(gdpPercap). What do you notice?
```{r}

```
