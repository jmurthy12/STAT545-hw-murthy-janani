# Homework 3

## Links to files

The R Markdown file can be found [here.](https://github.com/jmurthy12/STAT545-hw-murthy-janani/blob/master/hw03/hw03_gapminder.Rmd)

And the Markdown file with images embedded, [here.](https://github.com/jmurthy12/STAT545-hw-murthy-janani/blob/master/hw03/hw03_gapminder.md)

### Report your process.Reflect on what was hard/easy, problems you solved, helpful tutorials you read, etc. What things were hard, even though you saw them in class? What was easy(-ish) even though we havenâ€™t done it in class?

Compared to the previous 2 assignments ,this assignment was time consuming .
I did learn a lot on dpylr functions and ggplot in this assignment.
This [Cheet Sheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ggplot2-cheatsheet.pdf) helped a lot in implementing dpylr functions.



### Readme file
Since was done as a part of hw01 and hw02.No problems encountered here, links were easily added!

### R Markdown
Creating a markdown file was quite easy!
I did refer to [class notes](http://stat545.com/cm006_tibbles-dplyr-ggplot2.html)for ggplot and dplyr functions.

This [link](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gapminder/gapminder.pdf) helped in discovering colors for different countries as well as the syntax to be used in ggplot.

The Help tab/?help was very useful in exploring different function within R.
