### Report

This activity was interesting and challenging.But due to shortage of time I couldn't explore deep into the concepts of Web scrapping.However , I did manage to scrape some data from web for this assignment.Learning how to use HTTR was the most difficult part of the assignment.
Jenny Bryan's tutorial and STAT 545 was of great help in completing this acitivity.
I shall try other methods such as wrapped APIs and scraping.
