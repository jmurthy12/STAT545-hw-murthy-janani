####Progress Report along with Links to references.

- My reference for all the forcats related operations is available [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/forcats/forcats.pdf)

- As stated in my earlier reports,for dplyr functions my reference was: [class notes](http://stat545.com/cm006_tibbles-dplyr-ggplot2.html) for ggplot and dplyr functions.

- The Help tab/?help was very useful in exploring different function within R.

- During my peer review ,I learnt that using "suppressPackageStartupMessages" helps in tidying ,and hence have incorporated the same.

- Reference for activity on File I/O : [Getting data in and out of R](http://stat545.com/block026_file-out-in.html)

- Again for Colours ,I referred to [class notes cm013](http://stat545.com/cm013-notes_and_exercises.html)

- Roadblocks faced while completing this assignment are explained uder the "Learnings" subtitle [here.](https://github.com/jmurthy12/STAT545-hw-murthy-janani/tree/master/hw05/hw05.md)

- Incorporated peer review comments provided for my [homework3](https://github.com/jmurthy12/STAT545-hw-murthy-janani/issues/3),here,I was asked to add figures side-by-side.Referred to Link shared in class notes[cm013](http://stat545.com/block020_multiple-plots-on-a-page.html#use-the-multiplot-function) for incorporating peer review comments.

- Referred to [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18024810/why-am-i-getting-error-could-not-find-function-multiplot-in-rshiny-app) for multiplot.

I found this homework to be ,not-so-hard but at the same time it was not-so-easy aswell.This homework was time-consuming but I did learn lot of useful topics such as forcats,File I/O results and Colours(Visualisation).
