### Readme file
Since was done as a part of hw01,hw02 and hw03.No problems encountered here, links were easily added!

### R Markdown
Creating a markdown file was quite easy!
I did refer to [class notes](http://stat545.com/cm006_tibbles-dplyr-ggplot2.html) for ggplot and dplyr functions.

The Help tab/?help was very useful in exploring different function within R.
